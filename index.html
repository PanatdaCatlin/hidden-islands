    <h1>Hidden Islands that you never knew existed!</h1>
      <h2>...Until Now!</h2>
        <p>Have you ever felt the urge to travel somewhere that you didn't even know existed? Do you want to show off to your friends and go somewhere that they have never even heard of? Check out these three fantastic travel locations!</p>
      <h2>The Azores, Portugal</h2>

        <p>Isolated in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Azores, a Portuguese island chain unknown to most Americans, feels remote but is actually closer to the U.S. than any other point in Europe. Each of the nine volcanic islands—from main island Sao Miguel to the tiny isle of Corvo (population: about 400)—exudes a distinct character. But all of the islands are rooted in Old World charm and offer plenty of ways to experience local culture and the outdoors. Feel the spray from the world's biggest mammals on a whale watch, hike up calderas to pristine crater lakes, or go spelunking though extinct lava tubes. Just be sure to make time to savor the local cuisine, which prides itself on wine, artisan-made cheeses, and seafood from the islands' rich ocean waters.</p>
      <h2>Summer Isles, Scotland</h2>

        <p>A cafe. A post office. And a handful of snug holiday cottages. What more do you need when you truly want to get away? In the Summer Isles, a little-known archipelago of mostly deserted islands in the Scottish Highlands, crowds and modern life are out and rugged coastlines and pristine beaches are in. The largest and only inhabited isle, Tanera Mor, offers the only bit of civilization while still feeling remote. The isle doesn't have roads and it can't accommodate more than 35 people, but what it does have are hundreds of acres of bogs and peat-covered slopes, abundant wildlife, and plenty of inspiration for aspiring artists and writers. If a short stay isn't enough, consider the role of island keeper. Rumor has it that Tanera Mor is up for sale.</p>
      <h2>San Andres, Columbia</h2>

        <p>Want old-school Caribbean without all the resorts and glamour? Then San Andres might be for you. Part of an island chain in the Caribbean Sea about 435 miles from the Colombian mainland, San Andres boasts a rich native Raizal culture with English, Dutch, African, and Spanish influences. Locals, especially in the small village of La Loma, still converse in Creole and maintain traditions such as making handicrafts from coconut and totumo wood. The favorite island dish? Rondon, a stew made with fish, yucca, plantains, and dumplings (or "domplines"), all simmered in coconut milk. The outdoors is the main draw for tourists, though. On land, visitors can circle the island by scooter, while stopping to explore hidden coves or feel the sway of coconut palms. San Andres' seahorse shape hints at what lies beneath its waters: a fish-filled coral reef that is part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.</p>
